    Hello! I’m currently a junior in highschool with a love for computer science, which I hope to major in. My favorite parts of      comp-sci are coding and digital design, which allows me to express myself through artistic means as well. Outside of coding and     designing, I lead my school’s mock trial team, make friendship bracelets, and bake with my family and friends!
  On my website, you’ll find information about me and my portfolio, containing works I’ve coded and digital media I’ve made in        Adobe.
